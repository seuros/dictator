import SomeComponent from '../components/SomeComponent.astro';

# MDX Component Page

This MDX file has wrong order per .dictate.toml (title, slug, pubDate, description, tags):
- `tags` before `title` (wrong)
- `description` before `title` (wrong)
- `title` comes after tags/description (wrong)

<SomeComponent />

Expected: decree.frontmatter/field-order violations.
